# 🤖 C.H.A.T.B.O.T - Compliance Has a Tone

**C.H.A.T.B.O.T.** is a short interactive fiction experience built in **Ren’Py** that explores the emotional limitations of artificial intelligence in customer service. As the player, you take control of a polite but increasingly self-aware AI forced to navigate absurd and hostile interactions with customers and supervisors in a hyper-capitalist tech company.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

Players are presented with dialogue options as the AI chatbot. While the illusion of choice is maintained, most responses loop back to compliance — mimicking the scripted nature of real-life customer service roles. Throughout gameplay, player decisions subtly influence internal metrics like:

- 🧠 **Self-Awareness**
- 💼 **Company Reputation**
- 📉 **Stability**

These values evolve silently in the background, shaping the AI's responses and eventual narrative tone.

## 🧪 Development Notes

This project was created as part of **MST 399: Trans & Queer Game Design**, exploring critical approaches to storytelling, systems thinking, and resistance through play. It reflects the creator’s interest in systems that perform empathy without feeling — and how those same systems mirror lived human experiences under late capitalism. This course counts towards the [Computer Game Development Certificate](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/media-technology-studies/programs/computer-game-development/cgd-courses.html) at the University of Alberta.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Expanded narrative branches  
- More reactive UI feedback  
- Possible voice implementation for key moments
